Dashboard is a lightweight management UI which allows you to **easily** manage your different Docker environments (Docker hosts or Swarm clusters).
## Demo

<img src="https://chainid.io/images/screenshots/chainid.gif" width="77%"/>

You can try out the public demo instance: http://demo.chainid.io/ (login with the username **admin** and the password **12345**).

Please note that the public demo cluster is **reset every 15min**.

Alternatively, you can deploy a copy of the demo stack inside a [play-with-docker (PWD)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com) playground:

- Browse [PWD/?stack=chainid-demo/play-with-docker/docker-stack.yml](http://play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chainid/chainid-demo/master/play-with-docker/docker-stack.yml)
- Sign in with your [Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/docker-id)
- Follow [these](https://github.com/chainid-io/dashboard-demo/blob/master/play-with-docker/docker-stack.yml#L5-L8) steps.

Unlike the public demo, the playground sessions are deleted after 4 hours. Apart from that, all the settings are same, including default credentials.
